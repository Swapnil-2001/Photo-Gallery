# Photo-Gallery

A photo gallery app built with React and using Firestore as the database. Users can log in with their Google accounts to use the app. Features include adding photos, providing captions to photos, viewing captions, searching photos by the date they were saved on, and deleting photos. The library Framer motion was used for the animations involved.
